# Roblox-Multi-Instance-UWP
Multi-Instance for roblox UWP(microsoft store roblox). This lets you launch multiple roblox accounts via clones. this doesnt auto update, you must grab the latest UWP version and clone it when it updates. or I might provide a placeholder clone every update. Also has an Anti-Afk built in, along with debug console.
Anti-Afk is toggleable. It focuses and sends real keystrokes to ALL roblox UWP instances every 5 minutes, then returns to your originally focused window so you can continue using your computer while anti-afk runs.
Let me know any features you want that are realistic.
this was coded entirely with ChatGPT, because I didn't want to risk installing a virus through roblox account manager.
